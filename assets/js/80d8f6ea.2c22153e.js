More specifically, the primary objective was to create an IoT-compatible floating solar panel unit, which automatically tracked (aligned) its panel to the sun. The unit must do this efficiently (absorb the max amount of power, and use the least amount of power) while being durable, lightweight, environmentally friendly, and cost effective. The methodology used in developing the solution (the product) commenced with conceptualizing. Here, stakeholder needs (campers, environmental organizations, etc) were translated to product requirements. After deriving the floating solar panel\u2019s required functions, and the ways in which they can be achieved (different sun tracking mechanisms, floatation devices, etc), design concepts were sketched. These concepts were then evaluated based on camper (and other) needs. The optimal concept was found to be an amalgamation of two separate design concepts. This solution was found to be lightweight, durable, easy to assemble, and cheap to fabricate. The methodology moved on to technical analysis, determining critical component sizes (such as floatation device size needed, battery size needed, etc). This phase also determined other performance metrics to be met, such as the required torque capacity of motors, and motion range of the chosen tracking mechanism. This phase was followed by prototype fabrication and testing. This methodology resulted in the prototype meeting all of the main user requirements. The prototype was able to float on water using PET soda bottles, tracked the sun with its two axis mechanism (thus efficiently collecting solar power), and was IoT compatible. Additionally, it fulfils the secondary goals by being. Its portability, durability, and environmental sustainability is thanks to its sturdy construction consisting of aluminum, 3D printed PLA, and PET plastic bottles. Its weather resistance is due to the design\u2019s inclusion of O-rings and gaskets. Its user-friendly design is attributed to its simple construction, and inclusion of minimalist components like buckles. This allows for easy disassembly and reassembly during transportation.The prototype was not without its imperfections.
